# BINP29 project database
This project was part of the BINP29 course at Lund University in 2020.

## Description
This code is used to allow collaborators in the SLE project to access, filter, analyze and output data from the project dataset in a web framework using flask. The original database is a csv-file which is stored in the "data" folder.  

## Installation
It is recommended to create a new conda environment for flask and to activate:
```bash
conda create -n flaskenv flask
conda activate flaskenv
```

Control the version and the environments:
```bash
flask --version
conda info --envs
```

After cloning this repository, the following packages are required:
```python
pip install numpy
pip install Flask-WTF
pip install pandas
pip install matplotlib
pip install seaborn
pip install sklearn
```

## Usage
Change in the "src" folder in the cloned repository.

flask run
```
